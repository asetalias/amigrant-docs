# Amigrant: A PWA for amizone.

Amigrant is supposed to be a project which addresses the problems and shortcomings of [amizone](s.amizone.net).
It'll provide a PWA(progressive web app) without the need to login again-and-again i.e your credentials will be cached locally on your browser.

The PWA will offer all the features currently supported by the [go-amizone API](https://github.com/go-amizone/go-amizone) along with a discussion thread similar to reddit or twitter. 
It'll also provide an API for amizone bots like [Amibot](https://github.com/asetalias/amibot), [Amibot-tg](https://github.com/asetalias/amibot-tg) and [Amibot discord](https://github.com/Blonteractor/discord-amibot).

## Project vision

<Steps>

### Extract structured metadata from PYQ's

There are approximately 12.5k pyq's from Amity University, Gurugram's [question bank](https://www.amity.edu/gurugram/questionbank.aspx) + pyq's contributed by the community.
So we will first need to extract the text using [OCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) then extract the structured metadata from them using [NER](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/named-entity-recognition/) or by [open source LLM](https://ollama.ai/library) through [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/)

The metadata will include but not limited to:

- Subject/Course code
- Subject/Course name
- Exam type: Minor/Major, Mid-term, End-term
- Date: Month-Year(2024)
- Set


### Design UI/UX

We will use the components from [shadcn/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and customize them to our needs. Along with this we will **NOT** be using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) rather we will be utilizing custom CSS.

**Resources:**

- [shadcn/UI Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1203061493325953101/shadcn-ui-design-system)

### Server/API

The server/API will be written in [Golang](https://go.dev/) as the go-amizone [SDK](https://github.com/go-amizone/go-amizone?tab=readme-ov-file#sdk) is available. Hence, it'll provide a better development ecosystem as all the APIs, whether it is go-amizone or amigrant, will be in a single codebase.

### Testing

The project will have a holistic set of tests to provide better bug detection and error coverage.

### Documentation

The project's documentation will be generated using [Nextra.js](https://nextra.site/) and it'll contain information about the [Amigrant API](), [Amigrant PWA](), [conventions](), and [contribution guildelines]() related to the same.
