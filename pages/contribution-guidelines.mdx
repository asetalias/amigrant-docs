# Contribution Guidelines

We're glad that you are interested in contributing to Amigrant. Here are few guidelines and conventions to have a clean and structured codebase.
Please take a moment to read through them!

## Workflow

We are using a mix of [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow), [Github flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow) and [Forking workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow)
The upstream has 2 branches, `main` and `develop`. The main branch will not be used for any active development rather it'll act as a [`release-branch`](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow#:~:text=Release%20branches,-Once%20develop%20has&text=Creating%20this%20branch%20starts%20the,tagged%20with%20a%20version%20number) i.e the development will be carried out on `develop` branch(obviously) and the project maintainer will merge `develop` branch into `main` after the release cycle has been completed.

To fork a project follow these steps.

<Steps>

### Look for issues to resolve

First, go through the [project list]() and look out for `issues` to resolve. `issues` can be bugs, feature requests or something which you would want to add to the project.
Now check if anyone else is working on the `issue`, if not, then you can start working on it!

1. Click on the `issue` button

2. Now browse through the issues!

### Fork the project.

Now, from the [project list](), fork a project that you want to contribute to!

1. Click on the fork button.
